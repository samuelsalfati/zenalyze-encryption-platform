# START HERE - Platform Development Guide

## üéØ What Is This Repository?

This is the **Zenalyze Encryption Platform** - a healthcare-grade zero-knowledge encryption platform that will be licensed as a B2B SaaS product to healthcare companies.

**Key Facts:**
- **Separate from Zenalyze app** - This is its own product
- **Zenalyze becomes customer #1** - Reference implementation
- **Target market:** Healthcare apps needing HIPAA compliance
- **Business model:** Self-service API platform ($99-$999/month tiers)
- **Big vision:** License to Epic/Teladoc for $100M+

---

## üìã Current Status

**Phase:** Initial Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Repository structure created
- Strategy documents imported from Zenalyze
- Ready for development

**Next Phase:** Core Platform Development (YOU ARE HERE)

---

## üó∫Ô∏è What You Need to Build

### Phase 1: Core Services (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Client SDK** (`packages/client-sdk`)
   - Browser-based encryption utilities
   - Key derivation from user credentials
   - Zero-knowledge encryption/decryption
   - TypeScript, tree-shakeable

2. **Server SDK** (`packages/server-sdk`)
   - Node.js integration helpers
   - Key management utilities
   - HIPAA audit logging

3. **AI Privacy Service** (`services/ai-privacy-service`)
   - AWS Nitro Enclave integration
   - Decrypts data temporarily in secure enclave
   - Sends to OpenAI/Anthropic
   - Re-encrypts responses
   - Zero data retention

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Weeks 5-8)
4. **Key Management Service** (`services/key-management-service`)
   - AWS KMS integration
   - Key rotation
   - Access control

5. **Encryption Service** (`services/encryption-service`)
   - REST API for encryption operations
   - Rate limiting
   - Authentication

### Phase 3: Platform APIs (Weeks 9-12)
6. **Platform API Gateway**
   - Self-service signup
   - API key management
   - Usage tracking/billing
   - Documentation

## üìö Essential Reading (In Order)

1. **`docs/HEALTHCARE_PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md`**
   - Read this FIRST
   - Understand the business model
   - Market positioning ($8M ‚Üí $100M pivot)

2. **`docs/ENCRYPTION_STRATEGY.md`**
   - Technical approach
   - Zero-knowledge architecture
   - Why Nitro Enclaves

3. **`docs/COMPETITIVE_DIFFERENTIATION.md`**
   - What makes us different
   - Why we'll win

4. **`MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md`** (I'll create this next)
   - Technical architecture
   - Service boundaries
   - Data flow diagrams

5. **`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`** (I'll create this next)
   - Week-by-week implementation
   - Dependencies
   - Testing strategy

---

## üöÄ How to Start Development

### Option 1: Continue from where I left off
```bash
# Read the architecture
cat MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md

# Read the development plan
cat DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md

# Start with Client SDK
cd packages/client-sdk
# Follow instructions in DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
```

### Option 2: Ask me for specific task
Examples:
- "Build the Client SDK package"
- "Set up the AI Privacy Service with Nitro Enclaves"
- "Create the encryption service API"

## üéØ Success Criteria

**You'll know you're done when:**

1. ‚úÖ Client SDK can encrypt/decrypt data in browser
2. ‚úÖ Server SDK can integrate with Node.js apps
3. ‚úÖ AI Privacy Service runs in Nitro Enclave
4. ‚úÖ Zenalyze app successfully integrates all SDKs
5. ‚úÖ Platform API accepts customers and issues API keys
6. ‚úÖ Complete documentation for external developers

**Timeline:** 12 weeks to MVP
**Launch Target:** Q2 2025

---

## üí° Key Architectural Principles

1. **Zero-Knowledge Everywhere**
   - Server never sees plaintext
   - Keys derived client-side only
   - Even AWS can't read data

2. **Nitro Enclaves for AI**
   - Temporary decryption in secure hardware
   - Cryptographically isolated
   - Auditable attestations

3. **Self-Service First**
   - npm install @zenalyze/client-sdk
   - 2-week integration timeline
   - No sales calls needed (until $999/mo tier)

4. **Zenalyze as Reference**
   - First customer
   - Proves it works
   - Demo for investors/customers

---

## üîó Related Repositories

- **Zenalyze App:** `~/Documents/Projects/Zenalyze/zenalayze`
  - This will CONSUME the platform (customer #1)
  - Don't modify Zenalyze from here
  - Build platform independently

---

## üìû Questions to Ask Samuel

If you're unsure about:
1. **Business decisions:** Pricing, features, market positioning
2. **Integration with Zenalyze:** How the app will use this
3. **AWS budget:** Nitro Enclave costs, infrastructure limits
4. **Timeline priorities:** What to build first

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (when packages are created)
npm install

# Run all services in dev mode
npm run dev

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

---

## üéì Important Context

**Why this exists:**
- Zenalyze (mental health app) needs bulletproof encryption
- Rather than build once, build a platform
- License to other healthcare companies
- Pivot from $8M app ‚Üí $100M infrastructure play

**Why separate repo:**
- Clean IP for licensing
- Better fundraising story
- Can sell without selling Zenalyze
- Zenalyze becomes proof-of-concept

**Why NOW:**
- Healthcare AI exploding (regulation coming)
- HIPAA compliance is a nightmare
- We solve it once, charge everyone

## ‚úÖ You're Ready!

Read the docs in order, then start building. The architecture and development plan will guide you step-by-step.

**First task:** Create the Client SDK (see DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md when I create it)

Let's build something that changes healthcare! üöÄ
