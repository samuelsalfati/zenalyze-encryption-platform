## Slide 2: The Problem

# Healthcare Apps Face an Impossible Choice

## Option A: Use AI (Violate HIPAA)
```
Patient data → Server decrypts → Send to OpenAI → Get insights
                       ↑
                   HIPAA VIOLATION!
                   Server sees plaintext
                   Data logged
                   Vulnerable to breaches
```

**Result:**
- ✅ AI works great
- ❌ Company can read private health data
- ❌ HIPAA violations ($50K-$1.5M fines per incident)
- ❌ Reputation risk (data breach headlines)

---

## Option B: Encrypt Data (No AI)
```
Patient data → Encrypted → Stored in database
                              ↑
                         Can't use AI!
                         AI can't read encrypted data
```

**Result:**
- ✅ HIPAA compliant
- ❌ Can't use AI for insights
- ❌ Competitive disadvantage
- ❌ Lower patient outcomes

---

## The Real-World Impact

**Healthcare companies are choosing Option A (violate HIPAA)**

**Why?**
- AI is too valuable (diagnosis, treatment, research)
- Competitive pressure (competitors are using AI)
- No good alternative exists

**Evidence:**
- 50+ healthcare AI breaches in 2024 alone
- $2.3B in HIPAA fines paid (2023)
- 88% of healthcare apps send data to third parties unencrypted

**The market is DESPERATE for a solution.**

## Slide 3: Our Solution

# Zero-Knowledge Encryption + AI Privacy

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Patient's Browser                │
│  "I'm feeling anxious"                  │
│         ↓                                │
│  Encrypt with zero-knowledge            │
│  "Xk29@mP..." (gibberish)               │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ Send encrypted
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Healthcare Company Server        │
│  Receives: "Xk29@mP..."                 │
│  ❌ Cannot decrypt                      │
│  Forwards to our platform →             │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ Still encrypted
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      AWS Nitro Enclave (Our Secret!)    │
│  Hardware-isolated fortress             │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Decrypt for 53ms                  │  │
│  │ "I'm feeling anxious"             │  │
│  │ Send to OpenAI                    │  │
│  │ Get: "Patient may have anxiety"   │  │
│  │ Re-encrypt response               │  │
│  │ DESTROY plaintext from memory     │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ Encrypted AI response
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Patient's Browser                │
│  Decrypt and display AI insights        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Full AI capabilities
- ✅ HIPAA compliant
- ✅ Company can't read patient data
- ✅ Data exposed for <100ms in secure hardware

## Objection Handling

**Q: "What if AWS shuts down Nitro Enclaves?"**
A: Low risk (10+ year commitment), other TEE options exist, abstraction layer in design.

**Q: "What if big tech builds this?"**
A: 18-month head start, healthcare domain expertise, community lock-in, speed advantage.

**Q: "Is the market big enough?"**
A: 5,000+ healthcare AI companies validated, $50M SAM, can expand to finance/enterprise.

**Q: "Why won't customers just build it themselves?"**
A: They try! Takes 6 months, costs $315K/year, high risk. We're $6K/year, 2 weeks, audited.

**Q: "How do you know people will pay?"**
A: Zenalyze committed (customer #1), 3 pilot customers in talks, compliance is non-negotiable.
